## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://5c0b10b0-0633-4b5c-8594-696df3c95ebc.id.repl.co/snake_game.jpg)

Snake game is one of the most popular arcade games of all time. In this game, the main objective of the player is to catch the maximum number of fruits without hitting the wall or itself. Creating a snake game can be taken as a challenge while learning Python or Pygame. It is one of the best beginner-friendly projects that every novice programmer should take as a challenge. Learning to build a video game is kinda interesting and fun learning. 

We will be using Pygame to create this snake game. Pygame is an open-source library that is designed for making video games. It has inbuilt graphics and sound libraries. It is also beginner-friendly, and cross-platform.
